## Architecture Principles Successfully Implemented

### ✅ Single Responsibility Principle
- Every component has one clear purpose
- No component exceeds 150 lines
- Clean, focused functionality throughout

### ✅ Separation of Concerns
- **UI Components**: Pure rendering and user interactions
- **Business Logic**: Isolated in services (`TaskGeneratorService`, `ScaffoldGeneratorService`)
- **State Management**: Custom hooks (`useLayoutState`, `useFileTreeState`, etc.)
- **Utilities**: Pure functions in dedicated utility files

### ✅ Composition Over Inheritance
- Extensive use of shared components
- Clean composition patterns
- Flexible, reusable building blocks

### ✅ DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- 20+ shared components eliminate code duplication
- Common patterns extracted and reused
- Consistent implementations across features

### ✅ Type Safety
- Enhanced TypeScript coverage
- Proper interfaces and type definitions
- Reduced use of `any` types

### ✅ Performance Optimization
- Proper memoization with React.memo and useMemo
- Optimized re-renders
- Efficient state management
